# IC23_HabermansSurvival
The UC Irvine Machine learning repository contains many datasets for conducting computer science research.  One dataset they make public is the Haberman's Survival dataset, which is attached to this in-class assignment and also available online at (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman's+Survival).  The file, Haberman.csv contains survival data for breast cancer patients in comma-separated value (CSV) format.  The first field is the patient's age at the time of surgery, the second field is the year of the surgery, the third field is the number of positive axillary nodes detected, and the fourth field is the survival status.  In this dataset, the survival status is 1 if the patient survived 5 years or longer, but sadly 2 if the patient died within 5 years.


To understand this data further and make sense of it, your challenge is to write a Java program that calculates the average number of positive axillary nodes detected for patients who survived 5 years or longer and the number of positive axillary nodes detected for patients who died within 5 years.  A significant difference between the two averages suggests whether or not the number of positive axillary nodes detected can be used to predict survival time.  Your job, as a computer scientist, is to write the software that can separate the two.  Please do so with care and respect.
